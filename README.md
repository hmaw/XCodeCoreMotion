Images above are of the mirage project.  When running, it allows you to tilt the phone forwards and back, and flip it over.  the images make programatically images slowly circle around the center on the display. 

There is also two toggle buttons on the lower left corner.   The buttons randomly flip between multiple preset color themes and custom images such as pumpkins, hearts, triangles and other images.   Also implimented the flip where if you flip the phone 180degrees, it will toggle it to another random color theme and image.
